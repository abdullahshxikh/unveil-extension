# unveil-extension
Unveil is a stealthy Chrome extension that lets you bypass soft paywalls like The New York Times, re-enable copy &amp; paste on blocked websites, toggle dark mode, and instantly clean up cluttered pages. With one click, you can unlock blurred or hidden content, read freely, and take back control of your browsing experience.
